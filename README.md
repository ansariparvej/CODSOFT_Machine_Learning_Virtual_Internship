# CODESOFT: Machine Learning Internship Tasks

Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

# Tasks (Any Three)

## Task_1. MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

Description: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

## Task_2. CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Description: Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Task_3. CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

Description: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

## Task_4. SPAM SMS DETECTION

Description: Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages.

## Task_5. HANDWRITTEN TEXT GENERATION

Description: Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. Train the model on a dataset of handwritten text examples, and let it generate new text based on the learned patterns.
